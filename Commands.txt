Move this code elsewhere (whereever user input is being handled):
    string input, cmd;
    ifstream cmds;
    cmds.open("Commands.txt");

    vector<string> commands;

    //Reads "Commands" text file to add all commands to the vector.
    while(!cmds.eof())
    {
        getline(cmds, cmd);
        commands.push_back(cmd);
    }
    cmds.close();


    //Type "help" to print the "commands" vector.
    getline(cin, input);
    if(input == "help" || input == "Help")
    {
        for(string s : commands)
        {
            cout << s << endl;
        }
    }
